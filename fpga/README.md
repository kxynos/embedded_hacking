# Repo about FPGA stuff

My FPGA playground.

I have a TinyFPGA BX ([https://tinyfpga.com/bx/guide.html](https://tinyfpga.com/bx/guide.html)/ [https://www.crowdsupply.com/tinyfpga/tinyfpga-bx](https://www.crowdsupply.com/tinyfpga/tinyfpga-bx)) to run experiments on. 

So the examples I will provide will be tweaked for it. 

Examples:
- out_pin - example of pushing bits out of a pin (PIN_1) on a clock cycle. 
- out_pin_testbench - example with a testbench (wont work on board tho)
- out_pin_not - example with a not on PIN 
- notGate - a NOT gate example
- uart_hello - working uart output on TX line (PIN_2)
