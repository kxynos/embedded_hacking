# ChipSHOUTER picoEMP micropython script

WARNING: Use at your own risk and don't forget to give the device a rest. Can't be held responsible for any fires the code or device might cause. 

The script is a small modification of the micropython script by Colin O'Flynn [https://github.com/newaetech/chipshouter-picoemp/tree/main/firmware/micropython](https://github.com/newaetech/chipshouter-picoemp/tree/main/firmware/micropython). 

How to use the device with my [pico-pulse.py](pico-pulse.py) code:
* Rename as main.py and upload to picoEMP. 
* Arm the picoEMP (hit ARM button and ARM red light is on) and then hit the Pulse button. The device will continue to send EMP pulses until you ddisarm it (red ARM light is off). There is a indicator light (status flashes) everytime it pulses.
